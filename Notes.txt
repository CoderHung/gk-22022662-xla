Data:
    2 colored image data sets with non set size for 2 problem domains:
        +,counting objects
        +,finding objects
Method:
    Counting:
        3 methods including a count all objects, count objects with similar features, deep learning/computer vision to count objects of differnt classes
    Finding objects:
        
Testing and Evaluation:

Finding more data of the 2 problem domains
handle different image sizes

input: image
output: number of an object(in text) or the object given an image of the object

Counting

report:
problem: finding objetcs in pictures given the object image
solution: multi-scale template matching
which algorithms work well and why
colors?
size and rotation?
