Data:
    2 colored image data sets with non set size for 2 problem domains:
        +,counting objects
        +,finding objects
Method:
    Counting:
        3 methods including a count all objects, count objects with similar features, deep learning/computer vision to count objects of differnt classes
    Finding objects:
        
Testing and Evaluation:

Finding more data of the 2 problem domains
handle different image sizes

input: image
output: number of an object(in text) or the object given an image of the object

Counting

report:
2 problem domains:
    for finding:
        used template matching
    for couting:
        use deep learning methods

contour detection not working out 
template matching can generalize but contour detection seems to need manual adjusting
colors?
size and rotation?

deep learning?
classes?

Problem:
-  Finding or Counting objects in images
What to do:
-  Choose an image from a given set of images Tập file ảnhLinks to an external site.
-  Implement it (Python)
